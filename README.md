## Introduction

This repository is a collection of C programs that are meant to be
used as reference or reused (with the proper licenses, included
alongside the sources, for easy distribution). I encourage people to
explore the source code and learn from them, rather than simply copy
and paste it into their work. C is a particularly difficult language
because the programmer must pay close attention to fine details. I
try to document as much as I can right into the source code, in
addition to the READMEs and other Markdown files.

## Motive

My intention is to educate beginners, besides just solving particular
programming problems. I hope that the extra comments and instructions
that I have included in my work are useful and serve their purpose:
to guide and educate. This work is liberally licensed under the
MIT License, therefore, fellow developers can reuse this code in their
projects as long they provide attribution and follow the (very lenient)
terms of use, you should be grand.

## How can I help?

If you feel that this project was of (at least some) help to you, and
you want to repay me, then here's how to do it:
1. **Fix errors via Issues or Pull Requests** - If you come across any error,
   (intentional or not) you may raise an *Issue*. I will fix the Issue as
   soon as is possible for me to do. If you want to do it yourself, consider
   submitting a *Pull Request* with the updated code. 
2. **Contribute code (with the same license as I do)** - There will obviously
   be several prorgams that are not currently present in this archive. You
   may generously add your own implementations (with proper documentation)
   via a *Pull Request*.

## List of Programs
